  This ABM uses agents to move around a 300x300 grid environment and eat the environment. 
  This agents will move randomly, and move more quickly if they have less food stored, as they are hungry! 
  The agents will share food with other sheep nearby, but if they have less food stored will be more greedy.
  The agents will throw up if their food store exceeds 100. 
  The agents can become ill, and will be ill for a maximum of 5, until they either get better or may perhaps die from the illness.
  The predators will move around the 300x300 grid and eat the agents in the area if they are within a certain distance of them.
  The predators will throw up if their food store exceeds 200.
  The predators can kill the agents when they capture them to eat.
