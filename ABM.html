  This ABM uses agents to move around a 300x300 grid environment and eat the environment. </br>
  This agents will move randomly, and move more quickly if they have less food stored, as they are hungry! </br>
  The agents will share food with other sheep nearby, but if they have less food stored will be more greedy.</br>
  The agents will throw up if their food store exceeds 100. </br>
  The agents can become ill, and will be ill for a maximum of 5, until they either get better or may perhaps die from the illness. </br>
  The predators will move around the 300x300 grid and eat the agents in the area if they are within a certain distance of them.</br>
  The predators will throw up if their food store exceeds 200.</br>
  The predators can kill the agents when they capture them to eat. </br>
